I'm switching from dreamhost, which I've been using since 2006. (I switched to
Dreamhost from phpwebhosting.com, which I'd used for 4-5 years before 2006. Remember PHP?) 

I haven't really blogged on the wordpress I've had installed there since I began using
them, so it makes sense to try a new approach. 

The Jekyll thing had me a bit confused b/c I was trying to install the blog to
a `/blog` endpoint on github.io and it wasn't until I'd been pulling my hair out
for a little bit that I saw something on [their
site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) about
> GitHub Pages overrides the “Site Source” configuration value, so if you locate your files anywhere other than the root directory, your site may not build correctly.

So welcome to another blog. We'll see if the new format inspires something
remotely interesting/useful to the world.
