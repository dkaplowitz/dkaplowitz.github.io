I'm switching from dreamhost, which I've been using since 2006. I switched to
Dreamhost from phpwebhosting.com, which I'd used for 4-5 years before 2006. (Remember PHP?) 

I haven't really blogged much lately on the Wordpress I've had installed there
for 11 years, so it makes sense that if I'm going to resume blogging, I should try a new approach. 
I like using other people's resources, so I'm interested in seeing what hosting
on github is like. 

The Jekyll thing had me a bit confused b/c I was trying to install the blog to
a `/blog` endpoint on github.io and it wasn't until I'd been pulling my hair out
for a little bit that I saw something on [their
site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) about
> GitHub Pages overrides the “Site Source” configuration value, so if you locate your files anywhere other than the root directory, your site may not build correctly.

Anyway, I don't have much more to say on this warm, rainy day in NYC. So welcome to (yet) another blog. We'll see if the new format inspires something
remotely interesting/useful to the world.
